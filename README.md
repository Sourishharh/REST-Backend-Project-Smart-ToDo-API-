# Smart ToDo API

## Overview

Smart ToDo API is a RESTful backend service built to manage user-specific tasks securely.  
The application provides authentication, authorization, and full CRUD functionality for tasks, ensuring that each user can only access and manage their own data.

This project was developed as part of a backend project to demonstrate:
- REST API design
- Secure user authentication
- Database integration
- Clean backend architecture
- API testing and documentation

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js** – Lightweight framework for building REST APIs

### Database
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing users and tasks
- **Mongoose** – Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB

### Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – Authentication & authorization
- **bcryptjs** – Secure password hashing

### Testing & Documentation
- **Postman** – API testing and verification

## 🔐 Authentication

- Users log in and receive a JWT token
- The token is required to access task-related APIs
- Token is passed in request headers

## 🔐 Authorization

This project uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authorization.

After a user logs in, a JWT token is generated by the server.  
This token is required to access all **protected task APIs**.

### Authorization Header Format
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

If the token is missing or invalid, the request is rejected.

---

### How Authorization Works
1. User logs in using email and password
2. Server returns a JWT token
3. The token must be sent with every task-related request
4. If the token is missing or invalid, access is denied

## 📌 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST `/api/auth/register`
- POST `/api/auth/login`

### Tasks (Protected)
- POST `/api/tasks`
- GET `/api/tasks`
- PUT `/api/tasks/:id`
- DELETE `/api/tasks/:id`

## 🧪 API Testing (Postman)

All APIs were tested using Postman.

The Postman collection is included in this repository:
- `postman_collection.json`

You can import this file into Postman to test all endpoints.
